We are happy to announce that the Cormas project now provides three dedicated mailing lists to better support our community of modelers, developers, and collaborators.

## Why mailing lists?

Mailing lists remain a reliable, accessible, and lightweight way to connect people across institutions, projects, and geographies. They work everywhere - regardless of whether you use Gmail, Outlook, or your university address - and they keep discussions archived and searchable for the long term.

For a project like Cormas, which brings together researchers, practitioners, and developers from many different contexts, mailing lists are a natural fit.

## The new Cormas mailing lists

### `modelers@cormas.org`

A community space for users, modelers, and practitioners of Cormas.

- Share experiences, ask questions, and exchange models and practices.  
- Announce events, workshops, or training sessions.  
- Open subscription: anyone can join and participate.

### `devs@cormas.org`

A private list for the core developers of Cormas.

- Used to coordinate technical development, code evolution, and release planning.  
- Membership is restricted to the development team.  
- Keeps the developer discussions focused, while user support remains on `modelers@cormas.org`.

### `contact@cormas.org`

A public contact point for anyone who wants to reach the Cormas team.

- Designed for external inquiries, collaborations, and general contact.  
- Managed by the list owners; not a discussion list.

## Why self-host with Sympa?

There are many mailing list services available today, from Google Groups to commercial mailing platforms. We chose to self-host our own instance of **Sympa**, an open-source mailing list manager, for several reasons:

- **Autonomy**: We wanted full control over subscription policies, moderation, and archiving.  
- **Privacy**: No third-party service mines or monetizes community data.  
- **Integration**: Sympa integrates well with our infrastructure and allows us to configure different policies for modelers, developers, and contact.  
- **Community alignment**: Just like Cormas itself, Sympa is open-source software maintained by an active community.  

By self-hosting Sympa on our own domain (`cormas.org`), we ensure long-term stability, independence, and flexibility for how we organize our communication.

## How to get involved

- To join the **modelers list**, visit [https://lists.cormas.org/sympa/info/modelers](https://lists.cormas.org/sympa/info/modelers) and subscribe.  
- If you are interested in contributing to development, check our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cormas) or reach out to us directly.  
- For any inquiries, collaborations, or questions, you can always write to [contact@cormas.org](mailto:contact@cormas.org).  

We hope these lists will make it easier for the Cormas community to share knowledge, exchange ideas, and build collaborations.
