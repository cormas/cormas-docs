# How to reference Cormas - Citations & Canonical Bibliography

This page explains how to **cite Cormas** and links to **canonical platform papers**, the **methodological corpus** around Companion Modelling (ComMod) with Cormas, and a curated (broad) list of **field studies that used Cormas**. Where possible we include ready‑to‑copy **BibTeX**.

## Recommended citations

### 1. Canonical platform reference (origin)

If you need to cite the **creation of Cormas**:

- **Bousquet, F., Bakam, I., Proton, H., & Le Page, C. (1998).** Cormas: Common‑Pool Resources and Multi‑Agent Systems. In IEA/AIE '98 (LNAI 1416, pp. 826–837). Springer. [[Springer Nature Link]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-64574-8_469)

```bibtex
@inproceedings{Bous98a,
  author    = {François Bousquet and Innocent Bakam and Hubert Proton and Christophe Le Page},
  title     = {Cormas: Common-Pool Resources and Multi-Agent Systems},
  booktitle = {Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IEA/AIE 1998)},
  series    = {Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence},
  volume    = {1416},
  pages     = {826--837},
  year      = {1998},
  publisher = {Springer}
}
```

### 2. Platform overview & community/method use

A 12‑year overview of the community of practice that has emerged around Cormas:

(2012).** Participatory Agent‑Based Simulation for Renewable Resource Management: The Role of the Cormas Simulation Platform to Nurture a Community of Practice. Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 15(1), 10. [[JASSS Open Access]](https://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/15/1/10.html)

```bibtex
@article{LePa12a,
  author  = {Christophe Le Page and Nicolas B{\'e}cu and Pierre Bommel and Fran{\c{c}}ois Bousquet},
  title   = {Participatory Agent-Based Simulation for Renewable Resource Management: The Role of the Cormas Simulation Platform to Nurture a Community of Practice},
  journal = {Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation},
  volume  = {15},
  number  = {1},
  pages   = {10},

## Methodological corpus around Companion Modelling (with/around Cormas)

These papers frame the **ComMod approach**—participatory simulation coupling role‑playing games and ABM—and frequently reference or use **Cormas**:

- **Bécu, N., Perez, P., Walker, A., Barreteau, O., & Le Page, C. (2008).** Participatory computer simulation to support collective decision‑making: A case study from northern Thailand. *Land Use Policy, 25*(4), 546–561.
